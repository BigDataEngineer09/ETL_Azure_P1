# Realtime End to End Project using Azure ADLS,Databricks, Synapse and PowerBi

The project involves creating a comprehensive solution. It starts by extracting tables from an on-premise SQL Server database using Azure Data Factory, followed by storing the data in Azure Data Lake. Subsequently, Azure Databricks is utilized to transform the raw data into its cleanest form. The processed data is then loaded into Azure Synapse Analytics. Finally, Microsoft Power BI is employed to integrate with Azure Synapse Analytics, facilitating the construction of an interactive dashboard. Additionally, Azure Active Directory (AAD) and Azure Key Vault are incorporated for monitoring and governance purposes.
